[GRAPHOVERFLOW][1]
=====================

Here you can find a collection of info graphics and data visualization on various topic. Most of them are based on [stackowerflow.com][2] data , basically related to programming languages which are tags in questions asked. All data for stackoverflow is collected using [Stack API][3]. These are experiments with JavaScript data visualization library [D3.js][4]. Most of these data can be visualized with a bar or pie chart, but here I am choosing different types of data presentation just for the sake of it.

Source and build
----------------

I am using git [project page][5] for publishing the web content on the domain [graphoverflow.com][6] . The live source files can be found on `gh-graph` branch. [Grunt][7] is used for building the static pages , building scripts can be found at `builder` branch
