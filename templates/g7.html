           I got a good response for my previous visualization  <a href="http://graphoverflow.com/graphs/an-hour-on-github.html" target="_blank">"An hour in github"</a> eventually been submitted even in chromeexperiment. So one of the comments was really interesting ,it was something like "It would have been nice that we can get a data on a full day or a month" . So here it is , "A day on github".
</p> <p>
I went an fetch the whole data from GitHub Archive. GitHub Archive is a project by Ilya Grigorik , Thanks once again Ilya.
Yes the data was huge like 420K events one December 2014. Im sure today its more than half a million. The size was the problem , actually I want to show only when an event happen and what that event tagged programming language is,
so from around 100MB of JSON data what i want is around 23MB, 
 </p> <p>
from fig.1 to fig.2 
to convent this I tried different option , finally able to manage to this micro format around 5MB. Please let me know if you have more shrinking to suggest.

So each particle in background represent each event, particle color is similar to what is used in  "An hour in github" (events tab). You can see the tag wise list of event count JavaScript,Java,Python,PHP,Ruby,CSS,C++,C. </p>

It has some really cool API to get the data in json format from the archive. Those APIs are used to get the data of that particular date.
